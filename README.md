# Location-based-spectrum-management-framework
This project delves into the development ofoffline maps using QGIS, specifically focusing on visualizing antenna ranges across different locations. The primary objective is to create an interactive web map displaying detailed information about each antenna, allowing for customization and filtering options.

The primary challenge is to develop an interactive web map capable of accurately representing the range of antennas while providing users with customization and filtering options. Additionally, the map must dynamically update in response to changes in the input CSV data. Another problem is integrating terrain considerations, such as Digital Elevation Models (DEM), to facilitate precise viewshed analysis.
